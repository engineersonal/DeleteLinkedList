# Delete a node in the LinkedList at  a given index

# Description
You are given a linked list and a non-negative integer index. You need to delete the node at the given index of the Linked List.

Note: Follow one-based indexing.
Note: If the number of elements in the given Linked List is less than ‘index’, do nothing.

Example: 
Linked List = 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 15 -> 6 -> 25 -> 1 -> 11 -> 13 -> null
index = 4
Output:
Linked List = 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6 -> 25 -> 1 -> 11 -> 13 -> null

Linked List = 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 15 -> 6 -> 25 -> 1 -> 11 -> 13 -> null
index = 15
Output:
Linked List = 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 15 -> 6 -> 25 -> 1 -> 11 -> 13 -> null

Input: The input will be in the following format : 
The first line should be the number of elements in the Linked List.
The second line should be the elements of the Linked List space separated.
The third line should be the value of the index at which the node to be deleted.
